changes
=======
use \leq for "is subring of"

style
=====
say "if and only if" instead of "iff"
one sentence per line
use \(x\) for inline math mode instead of $x$ (tex-words needs this)
make a Hint macro and use it (badness check)
each exercise needs a label, which should be right after \begin{exercise} (badness check)
use \autoref for Section and Chapter and Figure, \eref for Exercise, and (???) (badness check)
no space between emph and index in definitions (badness check)



The Basic Problems
==================
visualization
  - commutative diagrams
  - divisor lattices
  - subring/ideal lattices
  - zero divisor graphs
classification
decomposition
construction
  - direct sums & products
  - subrings
  - quotient rings
  - polynomial rings
  - matrix rings
distinction
representation
solution



The Basic Questions
===================
what is the simplest example?
can any hypotheses be dropped?
can it be parameterized?



Topics
======
symmetric polynomials
formal power series
multivariate polynomials
