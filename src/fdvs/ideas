Vector Spaces & Linear Transformations
- Example: Free Vector Space on a set
- Example: Matrices as vector spaces
Subspaces
Span
Independence
Bases & Dimension
- TFAE: B is max ind set, B is min gen set, V is free on B
- Every VS has a basis
Matrix of a Transformation

Gauss-Jordan Factorization
- Define row echelon form
- Every matrix is row equivalent to ref matrix
- Define pivots
- Row equivalent ref matrices have same pivots
- Define reduced row echelon form
- Every ref matrix is row equivalent to rref matrix
- Row equivalent rref matrices are equal
- GJ Factorization
- Applications:
   bases for ker & im 
   solving equations
   deciding independence & span membership
   computing inverses
