In an incidence geometry, we have the ability to detect whether three given points are collinear. However an arbitrary incidence geometry has no notion of ``order'' for the points on a given line, as we intuitively expect. For instance, the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2,2)$ are collinear in $\RR^2$ and we think of $(1,1)$ as being ``between'' the other two. But in the Fano plane, does it make sense to order the points on a line?

\begin{dfn}[Betweenness]
Let $P$ be an incidence geometry. We say that a ternary relation $\BETWEEN{\ast}{\ast}{\ast}$ on $P$ is a \emph{betweenness relation} if the following properties hold.
\begin{proplist}
\item[B1.] If $\BETWEEN{x}{y}{z}$, then $x$, $y$, and $z$ are distinct and $\COLLINEAR{x}{y}{z}$.
\item[B2.] If $x$ and $y$ are points such that $\BETWEEN{x}{z}{y}$, then $\BETWEEN{y}{z}{x}$.
\item[B3.] If $\COLLINEAR{x}{y}{z}$, then at least one of $\BETWEEN{x}{y}{z}$, $\BETWEEN{y}{z}{x}$, and $\BETWEEN{z}{x}{y}$ is true.
\item[B4.] If $\BETWEEN{x}{y}{z}$ and $\BETWEEN{x}{z}{w}$, then $\BETWEEN{x}{y}{w}$ and $\BETWEEN{y}{z}{w}$.
\item[B5.] If $\BETWEEN{x}{y}{z}$ and $\BETWEEN{y}{z}{w}$, then $\BETWEEN{x}{y}{w}$ and $\BETWEEN{x}{z}{w}$.
\item[B6.] If $x$ and $y$ are distinct points, then there exist points $z_1$, $z_2$, and $z_3$ such that $\BETWEEN{z_1}{x}{y}$, $\BETWEEN{x}{z_2}{y}$, and $\BETWEEN{x}{y}{z_3}$.
\end{proplist}
\end{dfn}

If $\BETWEEN{x}{y}{z}$, we say that $z$ is \emph{between} $x$ and $y$. As shorthand, if $x$, $y$, $z$, and $w$ are distinct points, we will say $[xyzw]$ precisely when $\BETWEEN{x}{y}{z}$, $\BETWEEN{x}{y}{w}$, $\BETWEEN{x}{z}{w}$, and $\BETWEEN{y}{z}{w}$. More generally, if $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ are distinct points, then $[x_1x_2 \ldots x_n]$ means that $\BETWEEN{x_i}{x_j}{x_k}$ for all triples $(i,j,k)$ with $1 \leq i < j < k \leq n$.

\begin{dfn}[Segment, Ray]
Let $x$ and $y$ be distinct points in an ordered geometry $P$.
\begin{proplist}
\item The set \[ \SEGMENT{x}{y} = \{ z \in P \mid z = x\ \mathrm{or}\ z = y\ \mathrm{or}\ \BETWEEN{x}{z}{y} \} \] is called the \emph{segment}\index{segment} with \emph{endpoints} $x$ and $y$. If $z \in \SEGMENT{x}{y}$ and $z \neq x$ and $z \neq y$, we say that $z$ is \emph{interior to} $\SEGMENT{x}{y}$.
\item The set \[ \RAY{x}{y} = \{ z \in P \mid z = x\ \mathrm{or}\ z = y\ \mathrm{or}\ \BETWEEN{x}{z}{y}\ \mathrm{or}\ \BETWEEN{x}{y}{z} \} \] is called the \emph{ray}\index{ray} with \emph{vertex} $x$ \emph{toward} $y$.
\end{proplist}
\end{dfn}

\begin{prop}
If $P$ is an incidence geometry and $\BETWEEN{\cdot}{\cdot}{\cdot}$ a betweenness relation on $P$, then the following hold.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\SEGMENT{x}{y} = \SEGMENT{y}{x}$ for all distinct points $x$ and $y$.
\item $\SEGMENT{x}{y} \subseteq \RAY{x}{y} \subseteq \LINE{x}{y}$ for all distinct points $x$ and $y$.
\item If $\ell$ is a line and $x$ and $y$ distinct points, then $\SEGMENT{x}{y} \cap \ell$ is either $\SEGMENT{x}{y}$, $\varnothing$, or $\{p\}$ for some point $p$.
\item $\RAY{x}{y} \cap \RAY{y}{x} = \SEGMENT{x}{y}$ for all distinct points $x$ and $y$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}



\begin{prop}
Suppose $\mathcal{P}$ is an incidence geometry and $\BETWEEN{\cdot}{\cdot}{\cdot}$ a betweenness relation with the Trichotomy Property. Then the following hold.
\begin{enumerate}
\item For all distinct points $x$ and $y$, \[ \LINE{x}{y} = \{ z \mid z = x\ \mathrm{or}\ z = y\ \mathrm{or}\ \BETWEEN{z}{x}{y}\ \mathrm{or}\ \BETWEEN{x}{z}{y}\ \mathrm{or}\ \BETWEEN{x}{y}{z} \}. \]
\item $\RAY{x}{y} \cap \RAY{y}{x} = \SEGMENT{x}{y}$ for all distinct points $x$ and $y$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}



\subsection*{The 4-Point Property}


\begin{prop}
If $\mathcal{P}$ is an incidence geometry with a betweenness relation having both the Trichotomy Property and the 4-Point Property, then the following hold.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\BETWEEN{x}{z}{y}$ and $\BETWEEN{x}{w}{y}$, then either $\BETWEEN{x}{z}{w}$ or $\BETWEEN{x}{w}{z}$ or $z = w$.
\item If $x$, $y$, and $z$ are distinct points such that $\BETWEEN{x}{y}{z}$, then $\RAY{y}{x} \cup \RAY{y}{z} = \LINE{x}{z}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
If $\mathcal{P}$ is an incidence geometry with a betweenness relation having both the Interpolation Property and the 4-Point Property, then every line in $\mathcal{P}$ has infinitely many points.
\end{prop}
