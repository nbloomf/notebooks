Recall that an incidence geometry is called \emph{euclidean} if, given any line \(\ell\) and any point \(p\) not on \(\ell\), there is exactly one line passing through \(p\) which is parallel to \(\ell\).
So far we have avoided using any assumptions about the uniqueness of parallel lines, and have been able to prove a good number of interesting results.
We will now specialize to the Euclidean case for a while.

\begin{prop}[Converse of the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem]
In a Euclidean plane geometry, if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then alternate interior angles formed by the cut are congruent.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
(copy angle, use AIA, use uniqueness.)
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
If \(\ell\) and \(m\) are parallel and \(m\) and \(t\) are parallel, then \(\ell\) and \(t\) are parallel.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
We can assume that \(\ell\) and \(t\) are distinct (if equal, they are parallel).
Suppose BWOC that \(\ell\) and \(t\) meet at the unique point \(x\).
Since \(\ell\) and \(m\) are parallel, \(x\) is not on \(m\).
By the Euclidean property, there is a unique line \(s\) containing \(x\) which is parallel to \(m\).
But both \(\ell\) and \(t\) satisfy this condition, and they are distinct - a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
If \(\ell_1\) and \(\ell_2\) are parallel and \(m\) is incident to \(\ell_1\), then \(m\) is incident to \(\ell_2\).
\end{cor}

\begin{prop}
If \(\ell_1\) and \(m\) are perpendicular, and if \(\ell_1\) and \(\ell_2\) are parallel, then \(\ell_2\) and \(m\) are perpendicular.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
If \(\ell_1 = \ell_2\) there's nothing to do.
Otherwise \(m\) is a transversal and the result follows from the converse of the AIA theorem.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
If \(\ell_1\) and \(\ell_2\) are parallel, \(m_1\) and \(\ell_1\) are perpendicular, and \(m_2\) and \(\ell_2\) are perpendicular, then \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are parallel.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\(\ell_2\) and \(m_1\) are perpendicular by the converse of AIA, and then \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are parallel by AIA.
\end{proof}

\begin{construct}
Given 3 distinct noncollinear points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), there is a unique circle which contains all of them.
This circle is called the \emph{circumcircle} of \(\TRIANGLE{A}{B}{C}\), and its center is the \emph{circumcenter}.
\end{construct}

\begin{proof}
Let \(\ell\) be the perpendicular bisector of \(\SEGMENT{A}{B}\) and let \(m\) be the perpendicular bisector of \(\SEGMENT{B}{C}\).
Now \(\ell\) and \(m\) must meet, since otherwise \(\LINE{A}{B}\) and \(\LINE{B}{C}\) are parallel (which they aren't, as they meet at the unique point \(B\) (since \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are not collinear)).
Moreover they must meet at a \emph{unique} point, say \(O\), since otherwise we can show that \(A = C\).
Recall that points \(X\) on the perpendicular bisector of \(\SEGMENT{A}{B}\) have the property that \(\SEGMENT{A}{X} \equiv \SEGMENT{B}{X}\).
So we have \(\SEGMENT{A}{O} \equiv \SEGMENT{B}{O} \equiv \SEGMENT{C}{O}\), and thus \(\CIRCLE{O}{A}\) contains \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).
\end{proof}

\begin{prop} \mbox{}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Opposite angles of a parallelogram are congruent.
\item Opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent.
\item The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
For the angles, use AIA and converse of AIA.
For the sides, construct a diagonal and use AAS.
For the diagonals, use converse of AIA and ASA.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}[Thales' Theorem]
Suppose \(A\) and \(B\) are the opposite endpoints of a diameter of a circle centered at \(O\), and that \(C\) is a point on this circle distinct from \(A\) and \(B\).
Then \(\ANGLE{A}{C}{B}\) is right.
Moreover, \(\ANGLE{C}{A}{B}\) is congruent to the bisector of \(\ANGLE{C}{O}{B}\).
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Construct the point \(D\) on the intersection of \(\CIRCLE{O}{A}\) and \(\LINE{O}{C}\) by the circle separation axiom.
Now \(\SEGMENT{A}{C} \equiv \SEGMENT{B}{D}\) using SAS, and similarly \(\SEGMENT{C}{B} \equiv \SEGMENT{A}{D}\).
Now \(\TRIANGLE{A}{B}{C} \equiv \TRIANGLE{B}{A}{D}\) by SSS, so that \(\ANGLE{C}{B}{A} \equiv \ANGLE{D}{A}{B}\).
Thus \(\LINE{B}{C}\) and \(\LINE{A}{D}\) are parallel by AIA.
Now \(\TRIANGLE{B}{A}{C} \equiv \TRIANGLE{D}{C}{A}\) by SSS, so that \(\ANGLE{B}{C}{A} \equiv \ANGLE{D}{A}{C}\).
Now \(\ANGLE{D}{A}{C}\) and \(\ANGLE{B}{C}{A}\) are supplementary by the converse of AIA.
So \(\ANGLE{B}{C}{A}\) is right.

Now let \(M\) be the point on \(\SEGMENT{B}{C}\) such that \(\RAY{O}{M}\) bisects \(\ANGLE{C}{O}{B}\).
(Use crossbar.)
We have \(\ANGLE{O}{C}{B} \equiv \ANGLE{O}{B}{C}\) by Pons Asinorum, so that \(\ANGLE{O}{M}{C} \equiv \ANGLE{O}{M}{B}\) by ASA.
Thus \(\ANGLE{C}{M}{O}\) is right.
By AIA, \(\LINE{O}{M}\) is parallel to \(\LINE{A}{C}\).
By the converse of AIA, \(\ANGLE{O}{C}{A} \equiv \ANGLE{C}{O}{M}\), and \(\ANGLE{C}{A}{O} \equiv \ANGLE{C}{O}{M}\) by Pons Asinorum.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}[Converse of Thales' Theorem]
Let \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) be distinct points.
If \(\ANGLE{A}{C}{B}\) is right, then \(C\) is on the circle centered at the midpoint of \(A\) and \(B\) and passing through \(A\).
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let \(M\) be the midpoint of \(A\) and \(B\), and copy \(\SEGMENT{M}{C}\) to the other side of \(M\) at \(D\) by circle separation.
Now \(\SEGMENT{B}{C} \equiv \SEGMENT{A}{D}\) by SAS, and similarly \(\SEGMENT{A}{C} \equiv \SEGMENT{B}{D}\).
So \(\TRIANGLE{A}{B}{C} \equiv \TRIANGLE{B}{A}{D}\) by SSS.
Now \(\LINE{B}{C}\) is parallel to \(\LINE{A}{D}\) by AIA, and so \(\ANGLE{C}{A}{D} \equiv \ANGLE{A}{C}{B}\) using the converse of AIA.
Now \(\TRIANGLE{C}{A}{D} \equiv \TRIANGLE{A}{C}{B}\) by SAS, so that \(\SEGMENT{A}{B} \equiv \SEGMENT{C}{D}\).
Thus \(\SEGMENT{A}{M} \equiv \SEGMENT{C}{M}\).
\end{proof}

(Here we used a lemma that if two segments are congruent, then their midsegments are congruent.)

\begin{construct}
Given a circle \(\CIRCLE{O}{A}\) and a point \(B\) exterior to this circle, there exist two lines which are tangent to \(\CIRCLE{O}{A}\) and which pass through \(B\).
\end{construct}

\begin{proof}
Construct the midpoint \(M\) of \(\SEGMENT{B}{O}\), and construct circle centered at \(M\) and passing through \(O\).
By the circle cut axiom, \(\CIRCLE{M}{O} \cap \CIRCLE{O}{A}\) contains exactly two points, \(X\) and \(Y\).
Note that \(\ANGLE{O}{X}{B}\) and \(\ANGLE{O}{Y}{B}\) are inscribed on the diameter of a circle, and thus are right; so \(\LINE{B}{X}\) and \(\LINE{B}{Y}\) are tangent to \(\CIRCLE{O}{A}\).

(still have to prove these are the only two.)
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}[Inscribed Angle Theorem]
Let \(A\) and \(B\) be distinct points on a circle centered at \(O\).
If \(C\) is a point on \(C\) such that \(C\) and \(O\) are on the same side of \(\LINE{A}{B}\), then \(\ANGLE{A}{C}{B}\) is congruent to a bisector of \(\ANGLE{A}{O}{B}\).
In particular, any two such points form congruent angles.
\end{prop}

\subsection*{Altitudes and the Orthocenter}

\begin{dfn}
Let \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) be distinct noncollinear points, and let \(F\) be the foot of \(A\) on \(\LINE{B}{C}\).
Then \(\SEGMENT{A}{F}\) is called an \emph{altitude} of \(\TRIANGLE{A}{B}{C}\).
\end{dfn}

\begin{prop}[Orthocenter Theorem]
Let \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) be distinct noncollinear points.
Then the lines containing the three altitudes of \(\TRIANGLE{A}{B}{C}\) are concurrent at a point \(O\), called the \emph{orthocenter} of \(\TRIANGLE{A}{B}{C}\).
\end{prop}
