\begin{dfn}[Protoplane]
A \emph{protoplane} consists of the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A set $P$, whose elements are called \emph{points};
\item A ternary relation $\BETWEEN{\ast}{\ast}{\ast}$ on $P$, called \emph{betweenness};
\item A binary relation $\SEGCONG{\ast}{\ast}{\ast}{\ast}$ on $P^2$, called \emph{segment congruence};
\item A binary relation $\ANGCONG{\ast}{\ast}{\ast}{\ast}{\ast}{\ast}$ on $P^3$, called \emph{angle congruence}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{dfn}


\begin{dfn}[Axioms of Betweenness]
Let $P$ be a protoplane.
We say that $P$ satisfies the \emph{axioms of betweenness} if the following hold.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\BETWEEN{a}{b}{a}$ then $a = b$.
\item If $\BETWEEN{a}{b}{c}$ then $\BETWEEN{c}{b}{a}$.
\item \textbf{Four Point I.} If $\BETWEEN{a}{b}{c}$ and $\BETWEEN{a}{c}{d}$, then $\BETWEEN{b}{c}{d}$ and $\BETWEEN{a}{b}{d}$.
\item \textbf{Four Point II.} If $\BETWEEN{a}{b}{c}$ and $\BETWEEN{b}{c}{d}$, then $\BETWEEN{a}{c}{d}$ and $\BETWEEN{a}{b}{d}$.
\item \textbf{Interpolation.} If $a$ and $b$ are distinct points, then there exist points $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $\BETWEEN{x}{a}{b}$, $\BETWEEN{a}{y}{b}$, and $\BETWEEN{a}{b}{z}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{dfn}


\begin{dfn}[Axiom of Separation]
Let $P$ be a protoplane.
We say
