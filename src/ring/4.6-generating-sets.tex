\begin{prop}
Let \(R\) be a ring, and let \(\mathcal{I}\) be a collection of ideals of \(R\).
Then \(\bigcap \mathcal{I}\) is an ideal of \(R\).
\end{prop}

Not every subset of \(R\) is an ideal; in fact most aren't.
However, \emph{every subset of \(R\) is contained in a unique smallest ideal}.

\begin{prop}[Generated Ideals]
Let \(R\) be a ring and \(A \subseteq R\) a subset.
We define the set \((A)\) by \[ (A) = \bigcap \{ I \mid I \subseteq R\ \mathrm{is\ an\ ideal\ and}\ A \subseteq I \}. \]
Then the following hold.
\begin{proplist}
\item \((A)\) is an ideal of \(R\).
\item If \(A\) is an ideal of \(R\), then \((A) = A\).
\item \(A \subseteq (A)\).
\item If \(I\) is an ideal of \(R\) and \(A \subseteq R\), then \((A) \subseteq I\).
\end{proplist}
We call \((A)\) the ideal of \(R\) \emph{generated by} \(A\).
If \(I\) is an ideal and \(I = (A)\), we say that \(A\) is a \emph{generating set}\index{generating set!of an ideal} for \(I\).
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
Let \(R\) be a ring and \(A\) and \(B\) be subsets of \(R\).
Then the following hold.
\begin{proplist}
\item \((A) + (B) = (A \cup B)\)
\item \((A)(B) = (ab \mid a \in A, b \in B)\)
\end{proplist}
\end{prop}

\begin{dfn}
Let \(I\) be an ideal of a ring.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say \(I\) is \emph{finitely generated} if there is a finite set \(A\) such that \(I = (A)\).
\item We say a subset \(A\) is a \emph{minimal generating set} of \(I\) if \(I = (A)\) and whenever \(B \subsetneq A\) is a proper subset, \((B) \subsetneq (A)\) is also a proper subset.
\end{enumerate}
\end{dfn}

Important note: ``minimal'' here does not mean \emph{smallest size}, but rather \emph{contains no redundant elements}.
In general an ideal will have many minimal generating sets, and these may have very different cardinalities.
For example, the ideal \((3) \subseteq \ZZ\) is minimally generated by the set \(\{3\}\), but also by the set \(\{6,15\}\).

\begin{prop}
Let \(R\) be a commutative unital ring and \(A\) a subset of \(R\).
Then \[ (A) = \{ \sum_{i=0}^n r_ia_i \mid n \in \NN, r_i \in R, a_i \in A \}. \]
That is, in a commutative unital ring, the ideal generated by \(A\) consists of all finite \(R\)-linear combinations of elements of \(A\).
