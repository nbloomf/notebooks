In these notes we've been carefully avoiding the use of the real numbers, \(\RR\). Even though \(\RR\) is in some ways the most familiar example of a ring -- most of your mathematical training so far has taken place inside \(\RR\) -- our intuitive familiarity with \(\RR\) is deceptive. The real numbers are \textbf{very strange}, and it is far too easy to coast through calculus without appreciating how strange they are.

Nevertheless, the real numbers (and the closely related complex numbers) are extremely useful, and we lose something important by ignoring them completely. In this appendix we will fill this gap by constructing the real numbers from scratch. It turns out that if we approach this construction with the right amount of abstraction, we can build not just the real numbers \(\RR\) but a whole family of interesting rings.
